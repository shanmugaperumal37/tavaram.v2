Tomato: Septoria Leaf Spot


Reason :
Septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici. It affects the lower leaves of the tomato plant, causing small dark spots with pale centers. As the disease spreads, the spots enlarge, causing the leaves to yellow and eventually fall off. This weakens the plant, reducing photosynthesis and lowering yield.

Treatment :
To manage this disease, apply copper-based or systemic fungicides at the first signs of infection. Remove and destroy affected leaves to reduce spread. Rotate crops, avoid planting tomatoes in the same spot each year, and ensure proper spacing to improve airflow and reduce moisture that promotes fungal growth.
